# Library_App_with_Nodejs_And_Express
Node.js is a simple and powerful tool for backend JavaScript development. In this session, I will show you everything you need
to know to get started in web development with Node.js. We will start with the basics of Node.js and selecting an IDE. We will 
explore template engines, and rendering HTML out of Express. We will cover all aspects of routing including express middleware.
We will work with multiple database and backend APIs. I will cover local security with Passport.js.
